# Enable macOS HiDPI

## Explanation

[English](README.md) | [中文](README-zh.md)

 This script can simulate macOS HiDPI on a non-retina display, and have a "Native" Scaled in System Preferences.

Some device have wake-up issue, script's second option may help, it inject a patched EDID, but another problem may exists here.

Logo scaling up may not be resolved, cuz the higher resolution is faked.

## Recovery

### Normal

Still running the script in the terminal, but choose option 3

### Recovery mode

If you cant boot into system, or get any another issues, you can boot into macOS Recovery mode, and use the Terminal.app

There are two ways to close it. It is recommended to choose the first one

1. 

```bash
ls /Volumes/
cd /Volumes/"Your System Disk Part"/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/HIDPI

./disable
```

2. 

Remove your display's DisplayVendorID folder under `/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides` , and move backup files

Please use the single display to execute the following commands. If it is a laptop, turn off the internal monitor when turning off the HIDPI of the external monitor.

In Terminal: 

```bash
ls /Volumes/
cd /Volumes/"Your System Disk Part"/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides
EDID=($(ioreg -lw0 | grep -i "IODisplayEDID" | sed -e "/[^<]*</s///" -e "s/\>//"))
Vid=($(echo $EDID | cut -c18-20))
rm -rf ./DisplayVendorID-$Vid
cp -r ./HIDPI/backup/* ./
```
